agentveil-mcp — Model Context Protocol server for Agent Veil Protocol.
Enables any MCP-compatible client to interact with AVP.
Supports Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and any stdio/HTTP MCP client.

Usage:
    agentveil-mcp                 # stdio transport (Claude Desktop / Cursor)
    agentveil-mcp --http          # HTTP transport (remote)
    python -m agentveil_mcp       # equivalent to stdio transport

    """Build the ASGI app used by `agentveil-mcp --http`.

    Returns the FastMCP streamable-http ASGI app (a Starlette instance with
    its session-manager lifespan already wired), with two additions:
      - a GET /healthz route (unauthenticated) returning {"status":"ok"}
      - a bearer-token middleware enforcing Authorization: Bearer <token>
        on every path except /healthz

    We attach the health route and middleware to the MCP app directly rather
    than wrapping it in a parent Starlette. Wrapping breaks FastMCP's
    streamable-http session manager because its task group is initialized by
    the app's own lifespan, which ASGI does not propagate to mounted children
    by default.

    The MCP transport route is at `/mcp` (FastMCP default, see
    `mcp.settings.streamable_http_path`). When fronted by Caddy with
    `handle_path /mcp/*`, Caddy strips the `/mcp` prefix and forwards to
    this server; we therefore accept the transport at both `/` and `/mcp`.
    In practice Caddy's `reverse_proxy` (instead of `handle_path`) is the
    cleaner composition and is documented in the agentveil_mcp README for
    the hosted deployment.

    Fail-closed: if `token` is empty, this function is never called (see main()).
