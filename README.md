```python
from datetime import timedelta
from agentveil import AVPAgent

owner = AVPAgent.create(mock=True, name="workflow-owner")
agent = AVPAgent.create(mock=True, name="demo-agent")
agent.register(display_name="Demo Agent")

delegation = owner.issue_delegation_receipt(
    agent_did=agent.did,
    allowed_categories=["deploy"],
    valid_for=timedelta(minutes=15),
)
print(agent.verify_delegation_receipt(delegation)["valid"])
```

## Quick Start

### Run locally — no server required

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from agentveil import AVPAgent

owner = AVPAgent.create(mock=True, name="workflow-owner")
agent = AVPAgent.create(mock=True, name="demo-agent")
agent.register(display_name="Test Agent")

delegation = owner.issue_delegation_receipt(
    agent_did=agent.did,
    allowed_categories=["deploy"],
    valid_for=timedelta(minutes=15),
)
verification = agent.verify_delegation_receipt(delegation)

print("delegation valid:", verification["valid"])
print("scope:", verification["scope"][0]["value"])
```

For production identity, Runtime Gate, approvals, and signed receipts, see [Customer Integration](docs/CUSTOMER_INTEGRATION.md).

### Production integration shape

```python
from agentveil import AVPAgent

agent = AVPAgent.load("https://agentveil.dev", "my-agent")

report = agent.integration_preflight()
if not report.ready:
    raise RuntimeError(report.next_action)

outcome = agent.controlled_action(
    action="deploy.release",
    resource="service:critical-workflow",
    environment="production",
    delegation_receipt=delegation_receipt,  # issued by the workflow owner
)

if outcome.status == "approval_required":
    wait_for_principal_approval(outcome.approval["approval_id"])
elif outcome.status == "executed":
    store(outcome.receipt_jcs)
elif outcome.status == "blocked":
    raise RuntimeError(outcome.reason)
```

### Verify trust offline — no SDK required

```bash
# Get a W3C Verifiable Credential (VC v2.0)
curl https://agentveil.dev/v1/reputation/{agent_did}/credential?format=w3c
```

The response is a standard W3C VC with a `DataIntegrityProof` (`eddsa-jcs-2022`). Verify it with any VC library — Veramo, SpruceID, Digital Bazaar, or your own Ed25519 implementation. No AgentVeil SDK needed.

```python
# Or verify with the SDK:
cred = agent.get_reputation_credential(format="w3c")
assert AVPAgent.verify_w3c_credential(cred)  # offline, no API call
```

---

## Mode A Quickstart

Project owners can use AgentVeil as an action-control path for agents, tools,
workflows, MCP servers, and CI jobs inside one project.

1. Scan the project with Posture v0.1:

   ```bash
   pip install agentveil-posture        # (planned after Phase 1 acceptance)
   agentveil-posture scan ./your-project
   ```

2. Define local policy:

   ```bash
   agentveil policy init                # (planned for v0.8 / Phase 3)
   ```

3. Evaluate actions before execution:

   ```python
   from agentveil import evaluate_action  # (planned for v0.8 / Phase 3)
   ```

4. Produce signed evidence today with `controlled_action(...)`,
   DelegationReceipts, approval routing, and Proof Packets.

See [Mode A Quickstart](docs/MODE_A_QUICKSTART.md) for the full Project Owner
path and planned capability markers.

---

## Why This Exists

AI agents increasingly hold direct access to production credentials, deploy
workflows, and developer infrastructure. AgentVeil provides three things:

1. **Pre-runtime checks** — find risky agent capabilities (bypass paths, exposed credentials, missing approvals) before they reach production
2. **Runtime gating** — evaluate risky actions before execution, route through signed approval when needed
3. **Verifiable evidence** — produce signed receipts your audit / customer / partner can verify offline, no SDK or AVP API required

See [Security Context](docs/SECURITY_CONTEXT.md) for verified CVEs, market data,
and the structural problem AgentVeil addresses.

---

## Comparison

|  | Without AgentVeil | With AgentVeil |
|---|---|---|
| **Risky capability discovery** | Found in incident review | Pre-runtime posture check finds bypass paths, exposed credentials, missing approvals |
| **Risky action execution** | Agent calls `deploy` / `transfer` / `delete` directly | Evaluated before execution → allow / approval_required / block |
| **Approval on critical steps** | Rubber-stamped or skipped | Signed approval receipt — single-use, expiring, bound to exact action/resource/env |
| **Audit evidence** | "Agent triggered X" in app logs | Signed receipt with action hash, decision hash, approval hash, timestamp — verifiable offline by audit / customer / partner |

---

## Decision Inputs (advisory)

These advisory APIs feed the Runtime Gate's risk assessment. They inform
action gating decisions but do not grant execution authority on their own.
For direct reputation and agent-network usage, see
[Agent Network (Advanced)](docs/ADVANCED_AGENT_NETWORK.md).

For advisory selection and existing integrations, the SDK also includes:

- `can_trust(...)` — advisory score, tier, risk, and explanation before delegation
- `@avp_tracked(...)` — decorator for auto-registering and attesting local work
- Framework tools such as `AVPReputationTool`, `avp_should_delegate(...)`, and `avp_tool_definitions()`

```python
from agentveil import AVPAgent, avp_tracked

agent = AVPAgent.load("https://agentveil.dev", "my-agent")
decision = agent.can_trust("did:key:z6Mk...", min_tier="trusted")
print(decision["allowed"], decision["reason"])

@avp_tracked("https://agentveil.dev", name="reviewer", to_did="did:key:z6Mk...")
def review_code(pr_url: str) -> str:
    return analysis
```

## Features

**Action control surface**

- **Posture Checks** — inspect agent identity, status (active/suspended), and reputation signals before runtime
- **Runtime Gate** — evaluate risky actions before execution and return allow / approval required / block
- **Signed Receipts** — keep tamper-evident proof for gate decisions, approvals, and execution
- **W3C VC v2.0 Credentials** — export offline-verifiable credentials with `eddsa-jcs-2022` Data Integrity proofs
- **Webhook Alerts** — score-change notifications to any HTTP endpoint ([setup guide](docs/WEBHOOKS.md))
- **Framework Integrations** — SDK tools for CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, OpenAI, Claude MCP, Paperclip, and more

**Supporting signals (advisory)**

- **Reputation Signals** — peer attestations, confidence scoring, and advisory trust checks
- **Agent Discovery** — publish capability cards and find agents by skill and reputation
- **Dispute & Review Support** — attach evidence and review contested attestations

## Batch Attestations

Attestations from peer agents build reputation history that feeds future
Runtime Gate decisions.

Submit up to 50 attestations in a single request. Each is validated independently — partial success is possible.

```python
results = agent.attest_batch([
    {"to_did": "did:key:z6MkAgent1...", "outcome": "positive", "weight": 0.9, "context": "code_review"},
    {
        "to_did": "did:key:z6MkAgent2...",
        "outcome": "negative",
        "weight": 0.7,
        "context": "failed_security_review",
        "evidence_hash": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    },
    {"to_did": "did:key:z6MkAgent3...", "outcome": "positive"},
])
print(results["succeeded"], results["failed"])  # 3, 0
```

Each attestation is individually signed with Ed25519. Optional fields: `context`, `evidence_hash`, `is_private`, `interaction_id`.
Negative attestations require both `context` and a 64-character lowercase hex
`evidence_hash`.

---

## Security

- Ed25519 signature authentication with nonce anti-replay
- W3C `did:key` identity with Ed25519 keys for portable agent identity
- Input validation for signed SDK/API requests
- Agent status checks for active, suspended, revoked, or migrated identities
- Audit trail — SHA-256 hash-chained events with optional IPFS anchoring for published proof artifacts
