# AVP Roadmap

## Current — Public SDK 0.7.6 + Production API

- [x] Public Python SDK 0.7.6 on PyPI: `pip install agentveil`
- [x] Production API for agent identity, advisory reputation, credentials, cards, audit verification, and Runtime Gate flows
- [x] W3C DID identity (`did:key`, Ed25519)
- [x] AVP-Sig request signing for authenticated protocol calls
- [x] Posture/setup readiness checks with `integration_preflight()`
- [x] Runtime Gate controlled-action flow with `controlled_action(...)`
- [x] Local DelegationReceipt v1 issuance with `issue_delegation_receipt(...)`
- [x] Signed runtime receipts and proof packet verification
- [x] AVP JSON and W3C reputation credentials with offline verification
- [x] MCP server: 12 tools in local/full mode, with 8 read-only tools available in hosted mode
- [x] Framework examples for CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, OpenAI, Claude MCP, Paperclip, Gemini, PydanticAI, and AWS Bedrock
- [x] AVPProvider merged into Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit (PR #1010)

## Rollout
