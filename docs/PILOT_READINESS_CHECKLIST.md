# Pilot Readiness Checklist

This checklist is for the first guided customer integration using
`agentveil==0.7.2` and the production AVP API. It is a pilot operating
checklist, not a self-service onboarding promise.

## Scope

Use this checklist for one bounded controlled-action workflow with a known
principal, one customer agent DID, and one explicit action/resource/environment
scope.

Out of scope for this pilot checklist:

- fully self-service onboarding
- automatic DelegationReceipt issuance
- dashboard or inbox workflows
- production deploy, SDK release, tag, or PyPI publish
- marketing, website, or public positioning changes

## Before Starting

- Confirm the customer use case has one concrete controlled action.
- Confirm the action can be safely tested with non-destructive parameters first.
- Confirm the principal or workflow owner is identified.
- Confirm who can approve the action if Human Approval is required.
- Confirm where proof artifacts will be stored by the customer.
- Confirm no private keys, cloud credentials, raw private logs, or secrets will
  be sent to AVP.

## Environment Setup

- Install the pinned SDK:

  ```bash
  python -m pip install agentveil==0.7.2
  ```

- Create or load the local agent identity.
- Store the local Ed25519 private key securely.
- Use `AVPAgent.save(passphrase=...)` when persisting the identity.
- Register the DID with AVP.
- Verify that the DID is accepted for signed runtime requests.
- Treat a locally generated DID as incomplete until the production API knows and
  verifies it.

## Preflight Gate

Run preflight before any Runtime Gate or execution call:

```python
report = agent.integration_preflight()
```

Proceed only when:

- `report.ready` is true;
- API reachability passed;
- the DID is registered;
- verification status is acceptable when visible;
- the safe signed read check succeeds.

If preflight fails:

- follow `report.next_action`;
- respect `report.retry_after` when present;
- do not call `controlled_action(...)` yet.

This preflight does not execute actions, create approvals, or prove that the
customer's DelegationReceipt is valid for a specific action.

## Signed Query Check

Confirm the customer environment is using the current signed-query path.

- SDK must be `agentveil==0.7.2`.
- Signed requests with query parameters must use AVP-Sig v2.
- AVP-Sig v1 remains valid only for signed requests without query parameters.
- A `401` on signed query requests should be treated as a setup/auth issue
  until proven otherwise.

## DelegationReceipt

Before the first controlled action, obtain a DelegationReceipt from the
principal or workflow owner.

For the guided pilot path, the principal can issue the current v1 receipt
locally with:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

receipt = principal.issue_delegation_receipt(
    agent_did=agent.did,
    allowed_categories=["infrastructure"],
    valid_for=timedelta(hours=1),
)
```

The receipt binds:

- principal or workflow owner identity;
- agent DID;
- allowed category predicates;
- validity window;
- any customer-specific constraints needed for review.

DelegationReceipt v1 does not emit exact action, resource, or environment
predicates. Runtime Gate and execution cross-check the requested action,
resource, and environment after the receipt is supplied.

Provide the signed receipt to the first-action template through
`AVP_DELEGATION_RECEIPT_FILE` or `AVP_DELEGATION_RECEIPT_JSON`.

## First Controlled Action

Use `examples/first_controlled_action.py` as the operating template.

Start with the default safe path:

```bash
python examples/first_controlled_action.py
```

Proceed to Runtime Gate only after preflight is ready and the action scope has
been reviewed:

```bash
AVP_RUN_CONTROLLED_ACTION=1 \
AVP_DELEGATION_RECEIPT_FILE=/path/to/delegation_receipt.json \
python examples/first_controlled_action.py
```

For the first pilot run, prefer a read-only or inspection-style action such as
`infra.resource.inspect` in a non-production environment unless the customer
has explicitly approved a higher-risk path.

## Outcome Handling

The integration must handle all controlled-action outcomes.

`executed`:

- store `receipt_jcs` exactly as returned;
- store the Runtime Gate `audit_id`;
- export a proof packet with `agent.build_proof_packet(...)` if the workflow
  needs one bundled artifact for review;
- record the action, resource, environment, and SDK version used.

`approval_required`:

- store the Runtime Gate `audit_id`;
- store the `approval_id`;
- route approval to the principal;
- resume only after the principal approves;
- store the signed approval receipt and final execution receipt when available.

`blocked`:

- do not execute the action outside AVP;
- surface the block reason to the operator or customer workflow owner;
- preserve the decision metadata needed for review.

SDK/API errors:

- `401`: check signature, timestamp, nonce, DID registration, and AVP-Sig v2 for
  query-bearing requests;
- `403`: check verification, suspension, revocation, and role permissions;
- `409`: handle unsafe or incomplete workflow state such as approval required;
- `429`: back off and respect retry guidance;
- `503`: treat as backend unavailable or fail-closed signing dependency.

## Proof Artifacts

Retain these artifacts for the pilot record:

- DelegationReceipt;
- agent DID and public key;
- Runtime Gate `audit_id`;
- raw signed execution receipt text (`receipt_jcs`);
- proof packet generated from explicit local artifacts, if used;
- signed approval receipt, if approval was required;
- remediation case IDs and evidence hashes, if contested;
- SDK version and base URL;
- timestamped operator notes for any manual customer step.

Do not rewrite signed receipt text. Store the raw JCS string as the proof
artifact and use parsed receipt fields only as a convenience view.

## Go/No-Go Criteria

The pilot is ready for the first customer-controlled action when:

- SDK install is pinned to `agentveil==0.7.2`;
- local identity is created or loaded securely;
- DID registration and verification state are acceptable;
- `integration_preflight()` is ready;
- signed query requests use AVP-Sig v2;
- a DelegationReceipt exists for the exact requested scope;
- the first action is bounded and reviewed;
- `executed`, `approval_required`, and `blocked` paths are handled;
- proof artifact storage is defined before execution.

Do not treat the pilot as self-service ready if any step requires operator
interpretation or manual backend intervention.

## Current Limitations

- DelegationReceipt issuance is still an integration-owned step.
- Proof packet export is manual: collect the receipt, `audit_id`, approval
  receipt, and remediation references explicitly.
- Approval discovery/routing depends on the integration's workflow.
- Error handling still requires some mapping from HTTP status and SDK exception
  type to customer-facing next action.
- A successful preflight is required but not sufficient for action execution;
  Runtime Gate, Governance, Human Approval, and execution can still block or
  require approval.
